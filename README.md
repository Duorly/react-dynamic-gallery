# AutoPulse Project
## Pitch

This project consists of creating a dynamic photo gallery built from a local array of images.
The user can filter, like, dislike, or delete images interactively.

## Features

- Grid display — images are shown as cards with title and thumbnail.

- Like and Dislike buttons — local like and dislike counter for each image.

- Category filter — allows filtering images by category (Supercar, Sportive, Berline, etc...).

- Polished design — Tailwind CSS.

- React Highlights

- Use of .map() for rendering lists dynamically.

- State management with local state and props passing.

- Conditional rendering and event handling with onClick.
